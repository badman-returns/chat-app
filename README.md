    Welcome to the Grapevine Interview Process!
</h1>

Thank you for investing time with [Grapevine](https://gvine.app) and congratulations on making it this far in the interview process. This is a confidential document. Do not share this with anyone. This project is designed to serve as a representative model of the engineering process that we follow at Grapevine. It helps us benchmark all engineers on a common ground via this or a similar assignment.

### [Specification Document ¬ª](Spec.md)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How this works

1. **Start:** You receive access to this repository, which contains this README and a [specification document](Spec.md) that describes the project.
2. **Code:** You independently work on code that aims to fulfill the specification document.
3. **Debrief:** We meet for 30m to discuss the code you've written in an open-ended way, particular implementation choices you made, changing requirements, etc.

## üèÅ Goals

1. We see how you work within a representative environment on representative problems.
2. We see how you think and write code.

## üí° Tips

1. Try to highlight both the depth and breadth of your experience. Use this project to showcase your strengths and development priorities.
2. Candidates who spend *at least* 5 hours on this project tend to be more successful in our interview process, but there's no time limit (please see the prior tip).
3. We do not expect a production-ready code base. Please feel free to "cut corners" where appropriate: data persistence, infrastructure, and polished front-end design are all areas that could be ignored (or, focused on, if that's your thing!).
4. It's okay to reuse other code that you have written, as long as it fulfills the specification and you can explain how and why it works.
